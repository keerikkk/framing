### Commit Message Rules

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" instead of "changed" or "changes."
- avoid capitalizing the first letter.
- don't include a period (.) at the end.

### Commit Message Format!

- feat: add a new feature
- fix: a bug fix
- docs: documentation only changes
- style: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: adding missing tests
- chore: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
